This is an academic statistics project primarily using R (Python coding is also included) and an open source dataset on Kaggle about mall customer segmentation, which was originally designed for machine learning.

While big data is the definitive trend, enterprises, like in this dataset, could be challenged with not enough data as well. Given the limitation of only 4 variables and 200 entries available, I adapted the analytical strategy accordingly. After citing economic census data from US Department of Labor as benchmarks, more insights on customer income distribution were successfully drawn.

Four main chapters of statistical analysis committed:
1. Descriptive analysis and visualization
2. Multi-variable OLS regression
3. Chi squared analysis of household income categories measured against population data provided by US Department of Labor
4. Using age as a predictor of customer spending score
